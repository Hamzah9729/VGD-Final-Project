My game is called Volcano Rumble. The objective of the game is to steal the gem in the inside of the volcano. You move your character with arrow keys. I changed the size of my character and my character's gravity
scale to 1.5. I'm so proud of my game being able to switch scenes. I had trouble creating a new scene, but I was able to figure it out.
